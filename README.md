# Rename-Files
A project completed for the Udacity Fullstack Web Developer Nanodegree and my first project with Python

## prank.zip
This is a file filled with 50 pictures that are used to create a riddle. Kunal's co-workers took his keys and he must solve this riddle to find them.This file will need to be unzipped and it's path set in rename_files.py

## rename_files.py
This is the main class in the project and will iterate through prank.zip in order to rename each file so that it no longer contains a number. Once the number is removed, the files will sort into their proper order and a message will be revealed.
